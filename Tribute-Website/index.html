            serving from 1990 to 2012 and again as interim chairman from October
            2016 to January 2017. He is widely recognized for transforming the

            his vision of safe and economic transportation for middle-class
            families. Beyond business, Ratan Tata is respected for his
            simplicity, humility, ethics, and commitment to social welfare.
            Through the Tata Trusts, he has contributed billions to education,
            healthcare, rural development, cancer research, and technology
            innovation. His legacy continues to inspire young entrepreneurs
            across the world.
